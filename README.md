# CatText
This script uses the Twilio API to send a random cat picture to someone using TheCatAPI.  Phone numbers and keys have been censored for obvious reasons.  Along with Twilio API and TheCatAPI, Sinatra and Heroku are used to host the server running the app.

Free free to donate to keep the service running, it shouldn't need more than $2-$3 per month to keep it alive. Thanks
